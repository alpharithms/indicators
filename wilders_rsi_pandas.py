    """
    An implementation of Wells Wilder's RSI calculation as outlined in
    his 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems" which makes
    use of the Î±-1 Wilder Smoothing Method of calculating the average
    gains and losses across trading periods and the Pandas library.

    @author: https://github.com/alphazwest
    Args:
        df: pandas.DataFrame - a Pandas Dataframe object
        window_length: int - the period over which the RSI is calculated. Default is 14
        output: str or None - optional output path to save data as CSV
        price: str - the column name from which the RSI values are calcuated. Default is 'Close'

    Returns:
        DataFrame object with columns as such, where xxx denotes an inconsequential
        name of the provided first column:
            ['xxx', 'diff', 'gain', 'loss', 'avg_gain', 'avg_loss', 'rs', 'rsi']
